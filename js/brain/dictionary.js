/**
 * dictionary.js — Unity's Learned Vocabulary
 *
 * The brain's own language system. Words stored as cortex activation
 * patterns associated with emotional states and usage contexts.
 * The dictionary grows from every interaction — words the brain
 * hears get stored, words it uses get reinforced.
 *
 * Thesaurus emerges from synaptic proximity — similar words have
 * similar cortex patterns because they were learned in similar states.
 * "Angry" and "furious" overlap in neuron space. Arousal level
 * selects the synonym naturally.
 *
 * Sentence construction via cortex sequential prediction:
 * ŝ = W·x predicts next word from current word's pattern.
 *
 * No hardcoded vocabulary. Everything learned. Everything persistent.
