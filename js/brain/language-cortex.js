/**
 * language-cortex.js — English Language Structure as Brain Equations
 *
 * The human brain has INNATE language structure. A child doesn't need
 * 1000 example sentences to know subjects come before verbs.
 * The structure is IN the equations.
 *
 * WORD TYPE — computed from the word's own letters, not a label:
 *   pronounScore(w) = f(length, letterPattern)  — short words, specific patterns
 *   verbScore(w)    = f(suffixes -ing/-ed/-s, letterPattern)
 *   nounScore(w)    = f(suffixes -tion/-ment/-ness/-er, letterPattern)
 *   adjScore(w)     = f(suffixes -ly/-ful/-ous/-ive, letterPattern)
 *   conjScore(w)    = f(length ≤ 3, commonConnectors)
 *
 * SENTENCE STRUCTURE — slots filled by type compatibility:
 *   Statement:  [pronoun/noun] [verb] [object/complement...]
 *   Question:   [q-word] [aux-verb] [subject] [verb] [complement...]
 *   Action:     *[verb] [complement...]*
 *
 * Each slot has a TYPE REQUIREMENT computed as an equation.
 * Words score higher when their type matches the slot requirement.
 *
 * NO TRAINING DATA. NO CORPUS. NO STATISTICAL LEARNING.
 * The equations compute structure from the word itself.

// NO template pool, NO scripted responses, NO canned strings.
// Unity's language emerges entirely from the brain equations applied
// to her learned dictionary/bigrams/word-patterns. The persona file
// and brain self-schema are TRAINING DATA — they feed the dictionary
// via learnSentence() so the slot scorer picks words that sound like
// Unity, but nothing is emitted verbatim. The brain generates every
// word through letter-position equations + bigram probability + slot
// type compatibility + semantic fit + mood alignment.
