REM /fresh or /clear flag forces brain state wipe on boot (overrides
REM the code-hash preserve behavior). Default boot preserves state if
REM brain-code source files are unchanged since the last run —
REM curriculum progress, passedCells, gateHistory, weights all survive
REM restarts. Use /fresh when you explicitly want a clean-slate retrain
REM (e.g., embedding refinements went bad, persistence got corrupted,
REM testing fresh boot behavior).
if /i "%1"=="/fresh" set DREAM_FORCE_CLEAR=1
if /i "%1"=="/clear" set DREAM_FORCE_CLEAR=1
if defined DREAM_FORCE_CLEAR (
    echo   [!] DREAM_FORCE_CLEAR=1 — will clear brain state on boot.
    echo.
)

REM Step checkpoints so operators always see progress. Prior reports of
REM "invisible translucent terminal with just the title tab" stemmed from
REM silent-output phases (port-kill redirected >nul 2>&1, npm/esbuild
REM presence checks that goto-skip on success). Each major phase now
REM emits a visible banner so if a hang ever recurs, the last printed
REM step identifies where.

echo [start] step 1/7: killing any prior listener on port 7525...
for /f "tokens=5" %%a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :7525 ^| findstr LISTENING') do (
    echo   [start] taskkill /F /PID %%a
    taskkill /f /pid %%a
)
echo.

echo [start] step 2/7: entering server folder...
cd /d "%~dp0server"
echo.

echo [start] step 3/7: checking npm dependencies...
if exist node_modules goto npm_done
echo   Installing server dependencies (first run, ~30s)...
call npm install
if errorlevel 1 goto err_npm
:npm_done
echo   node_modules present.
echo.

echo [start] step 4/7: checking esbuild...
if exist node_modules\esbuild goto esbuild_done
echo   Installing esbuild for bundle build...
call npm install esbuild --save-dev
if errorlevel 1 goto err_esbuild_install
:esbuild_done
echo   esbuild present.
echo.

echo [start] step 5/7: checking GloVe 6B.300d substrate...
REM Make sure GloVe 6B.300d is present for Unity's semantic substrate.
REM Without it, language cortex falls back to fastText-style subword hash
REM embeddings which don't cluster rhyming/semantic neighbors - production
REM probes at K+ grades struggle. Download is idempotent: skipped if the
REM file already exists; soft-fails to subword fallback if the download or
REM extract errors so the brain still boots.
if exist "%~dp0corpora\glove.6B.300d.txt" goto glove_done
echo   GloVe 6B.300d not found - downloading (~823 MB zip, one-time, 5-15 min)...
echo   Source: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
if not exist "%~dp0corpora" mkdir "%~dp0corpora"
pushd "%~dp0corpora"
REM --progress-bar gives a simple [====] progress line that doesn't use
REM carriage-return animation. Without --progress-bar, curl's default
REM progress table uses \r to overwrite lines, which corrupts CMD's
REM subsequent "if errorlevel" line parse (seen as "'rrorlevel' is not
REM recognized" from exactly this bug). Also using %ERRORLEVEL%
REM explicit check (more robust than bare "if errorlevel 1" against
REM prior curl progress state).
curl -L --fail --show-error --progress-bar --max-time 1800 -o glove.6B.zip https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    popd
    goto err_glove_download
)
echo   Extracting glove.6B.300d.txt (~990 MB from zip)...
tar -xf glove.6B.zip glove.6B.300d.txt
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    popd
    goto err_glove_extract
)
del glove.6B.zip
popd
echo   GloVe 6B.300d installed at corpora\glove.6B.300d.txt.
:glove_done
echo   GloVe substrate present.
echo.

echo [start] step 6/7: rebuilding js/app.bundle.js...
REM Build the JS bundle. The browser loads js/app.bundle.js, NOT live source.
REM Bundle is gitignored so every code change requires a rebuild.
call npm run build
if errorlevel 1 goto err_bundle
echo   Bundle built - browser will load fresh code.
echo.

REM Start brain server in background, wait, open the landing page tab.
REM --max-old-space-size=65536 = 64 GB V8 heap ceiling. Language
REM cortex is CPU-side for now (GPU port in progress) and its sparse
REM synapse + cross-projection weights live in JS-owned typed arrays.
REM The auto-scale logic in brain-server.js derives its neuron count
REM from os.freemem() and v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit, so
REM a bigger heap ceiling = bigger language cortex size. On a 128 GB
REM RAM box this lets the language cluster reach ~7-8 M neurons before
REM hitting the 50%-of-free-RAM constraint. Set even higher (128 GB
REM box could run 96 GB) if needed. Zero hardcoded cluster-size cap.
REM
REM compute.html is NOT opened here — the server auto-launches it
REM via brain-server.js `_spawnGpuClient()` once the HTTP listener
REM is up. This keeps `node brain-server.js` and `start.bat` both
REM one-command entry points; no duplicate tabs, no stale log
REM telling the operator to open compute.html manually.
REM --max-semi-space-size=1024 (1 GB semi-space per V8 new-generation
REM region). Default Node semi-space is 16 MB, which at biological scale
REM Phase 2 sustains external-memory allocation rates (worker-pool SAB +
REM curriculum Float64Array + Buffer pool) high enough that V8 can't
REM commit semi-space growth during Mark-Compact cycles → "Committing
REM semi space failed. Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of
REM memory" → FATAL. Bumping semi-space to 1 GB gives V8 ~64× more
REM breathing room; Mark-Compact can run cleanly under sustained
REM external-memory allocation rates of ~10 GB/sec for short bursts.
REM Combined with --max-old-space-size=65536 (64 GB) V8 has ~66 GB
REM of headroom, well below a typical 128 GB physical RAM ceiling.
REM --expose-gc lets cluster.initGpu() call global.gc() after the CPU
REM CSR free block to force V8 to reclaim the ~8 GB of external memory
REM immediately (instead of waiting for the next scheduled Mark-Compact
REM cycle). Without --expose-gc the null-assignments unref the typed
REM arrays but V8 can take seconds to minutes to GC them — long enough
REM for Phase 2 external-memory pressure to build and OOM before the
REM reclaim lands. Forced gc() after all uploads guarantees the 8 GB
REM is gone before curriculum teach starts. Heap-stats logging before +
REM after the forced gc() lets operators visually confirm the reclaim.
REM Brain-server stdout/stderr is redirected to server\server.log so
REM operators can tail heartbeat + brain info even if this launcher
REM terminal goes invisible (Windows Terminal + conhost rendering
REM glitches leave child-process output blind when the parent window
REM can't paint). A SECOND PowerShell window is spawned that tails the
REM log with Get-Content -Wait — a separate process, separate
REM rendering, so even if THIS cmd window is translucent/blank the log
REM window still paints. Fallback path: if the PowerShell tail window
REM also breaks, server.log is on disk at server\server.log and any
REM terminal can read it.
REM Force UTF-8 end-to-end on the PowerShell tail window. Node writes
REM UTF-8 bytes to server.log (emoji + em-dash + box-drawing chars in
REM curriculum heartbeats). PowerShell 5.1's Get-Content without an
REM explicit -Encoding defaults to the system code page (Windows-1252
REM on US Windows), which decodes UTF-8 E2 95 90 (═) as â• mojibake.
REM Plus the PowerShell console's OutputEncoding must be UTF-8 or even
REM a correctly-decoded emoji won't render right when re-emitted.
REM Setting both [Console]::OutputEncoding + Get-Content -Encoding UTF8
REM renders the log window cleanly.
echo [start] step 7/7: launching brain server + log tail window (GPU EXCLUSIVE)...
echo   server log: %~dp0server\server.log
if exist server.log del server.log
start /b "" cmd /c "node --max-old-space-size=65536 --max-semi-space-size=1024 --expose-gc brain-server.js > server.log 2>&1"

start "" http://localhost:7525
REM Dashboard auto-opens alongside the landing page so the milestone panel
REM (curriculum state, save-resume vs fresh-boot, passed cells, operator
REM signoffs) is visible from the first moment the brain is up.
start "" http://localhost:7525/dashboard.html
echo.
echo   Landing:     http://localhost:7525
echo   Dashboard:   http://localhost:7525/dashboard.html (auto-opened)
echo   GPU compute: http://localhost:7525/compute.html (auto-launched by server)
echo   Log tail:    separate PowerShell window "Unity Brain Log Tail"
echo   Log file:    %~dp0server\server.log (always on disk)
echo.
echo   NOTE: brain runs ONLY on GPU. compute.html MUST stay open.
echo   To STOP the brain cleanly: run stop.bat (Ctrl+C in this launcher
echo   or the tail window does NOT reach the detached node process -
echo   stop.bat sends HTTP /shutdown, then taskkill on port 7525 if
echo   needed, then verifies the port is free).
echo   Also close the http://localhost:7525 browser tabs - compute.html
echo   keeps WebGPU running even without the server.

REM Keep this launcher window open for additional manual commands.
