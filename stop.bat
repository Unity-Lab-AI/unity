REM Ctrl+C in the launcher terminal does NOT halt the brain server
REM because start.bat uses `start /b` which detaches node from the
REM launcher. This script gives operators a clean kill path.
REM
REM Three stages, ordered best-to-worst so we exit as soon as the brain
REM is dead:
REM   1. Graceful HTTP shutdown via POST /shutdown — node receives the
REM      request, runs its SIGINT-equivalent cleanup (save weights,
REM      close sqlite, etc.), then process.exit(0).
REM   2. If HTTP shutdown doesn't respond within a few seconds, fall
REM      through to taskkill on any PID holding port 7525.
REM   3. If the port is still held after that, best-effort force-kill
REM      every node.exe process on the machine as a last resort (the
REM      operator's launcher window only ever has one node for the
REM      brain so this is safe on dedicated dev boxes).
