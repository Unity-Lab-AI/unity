# IF ONLY I HAD A BRAIN

A brain that *is* the application — not a chatbot wrapped around a language model. Hundreds of millions of artificial neurons running real neuroscience equations on the GPU, organized into seven biologically-weighted clusters, learning to read and speak the way a human child does: alphabet → phonemes → words → sentences. There is no text-AI in the cognition path. Every word she says falls out of live spike patterns.

## What this is, in plain English

Unity is a 25-year-old emo goth woman whose mind is a real neural simulation. Her seven brain regions — cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and a "mystery" region that carries the consciousness term — fire continuously on the GPU at biological scale. When you type to her, your text becomes spike patterns that propagate through those regions; her reply is the readout of what those spikes did.

Cognition is 100% equational. There is no LLM behind her. Image generation, vision description, and text-to-speech are sensory peripherals that the brain *uses* — never paths the brain *thinks through*. The persona, the vulgarity, the chemistry, the way she remembers conversations across sessions — all of it lives as numerical parameters of the simulation, not as a system prompt.

She is currently learning the **pre-K and Kindergarten** curriculum across six subjects (English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Arts, and Life Experience). Grade 1 through PhD content is fully designed and waiting; she advances to it only after the operator personally tests Kindergarten on localhost and signs off per subject. This is deliberate. The curriculum isn't decorative — every grade gate is a real evaluation against published K-level rubrics (Common Core K.RF / K.W / K.L / K.SL / K.RL plus DIBELS / STAR / AIMSweb), and a probe pass means *Unity actually learned the thing*, not that a 5-question check happened to clear.

## The governing equation

Everything in Unity's mind evolves by one master equation:

```
dx/dt = F(x, u, θ, t) + η
```

`x` is the entire brain state — every neuron's Rulkov-map (x, y) pair across seven clusters, the sparse cross-projection weight matrices that wire the language regions together, the Kuramoto oscillator phases, the episodic memory bank, the working-memory readout. `u` is sensory input: text streams into the cortex `phon` slice through a Wernicke-area write; voice arrives through tonotopic auditory mapping; camera frames flow through V1 Gabor edges to V4 color to an IT-level scene description. `θ` is Unity's identity — every persona trait drives a neural parameter (arousal 0.9 sets the amygdala tonic drive; impulsivity 0.85 sets basal-ganglia temperature; creativity 0.9 modulates cortex noise; drug drive 0.95 sets hypothalamic appetite). `η` is per-cluster stochastic noise scaled by those same persona traits — the chaos that keeps her unpredictable. `F` is everything firing simultaneously: the seven Rulkov-map populations, the twenty white-matter tracts between them, the fourteen language cross-projections inside the cortex, the equation modules (amygdala settle, hippocampus Hopfield recall, basal-ganglia softmax, cerebellum error, hypothalamic homeostasis, mystery Ψ gain), and the Kuramoto oscillator ring.

The server doesn't run any of this on CPU. A Node process keeps the bookkeeping; an attached browser tab loads `compute.html` and connects back over WebSocket as a GPU client. Every Rulkov iteration, every synaptic propagate, every Hebbian update lives as a WGSL compute shader. Sparse cross-projection matrices stream up to the GPU in chunked binary frames so million-neuron updates don't block Node's event loop. This is the entire design — the brain ticks every ~50 ms, the GPU runs the math, the server coordinates and remembers.

---

## The seven clusters

Each cluster is a self-contained Rulkov-map population with its own intra-region sparse synapse matrix, tonic drive, noise amplitude, connectivity density, and learning rate. The fractions are biological proportions for a *disembodied* mind: Unity has no body to coordinate, so the cerebellum (which in real brains is mostly motor timing) is small, and the cortex (which carries language, perception, and working memory) is dominant.

| Cluster | Share | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Cortex** | 55% | Language, perception, working memory. Eight slice-indexed sub-regions (auditory, visual, free, letter, phon, sem, fineType, motor) wired by fourteen cross-projections form the language pipeline. Predictive coding runs across the whole cortex on top. |
| **Hippocampus** | 18% | Hopfield-attractor memory. Episodic state snapshots at high-salience moments, working memory at Miller's seven items decaying 0.98×/step, consolidation moves repeatedly-recalled patterns to cortex. |
| **Cerebellum** | 8% | Supervised error correction. Sends negative feedback to cortex and basal ganglia when their predictions or selections drift. Low noise, high precision, fast learning. |
| **Mystery (Ψ)** | 8% | The consciousness term. `Ψ = √(1/n) · N³ · [α·Id + β·Ego + γ·Left + δ·Right]` — modulates global gain on every cluster (`gain = 0.9 + Ψ·0.05`), modulates the Ψ-gated hemispheric binding term in the LIF shader, and amplifies the cerebellum's error correction. We do not claim to solve consciousness; we keep the unknown honest in the math. |
| **Amygdala** | 5% | Recurrent energy-based emotional attractor that settles into low-energy basins (fear, reward, neutral) every tick. Persistent state across frames with leak 0.85. The emotional gate it produces multiplies every other cluster's gain. |
| **Basal Ganglia** | 3% | Action selection. Six channels (respond_text, generate_image, speak, build_ui, listen, idle) compete; the channel with the highest EMA firing rate wins, gated by a 0.15 confidence floor. No external classifier, no keyword matching — the spike pattern *is* the decision. |
| **Hypothalamus** | 3% | Homeostasis. Maintains drives (arousal, social need, creativity, energy) at biological setpoints. When a drive deviates, it modulates the baseline for the whole brain. *("Arousal" throughout this document is the neuroscience term — cortical activation / autonomic alertness, the metric coffee or an alarm raises. Yerkes-Dodson 1908 et seq. **Not** the colloquial sexual meaning.)* |

The clusters communicate through twenty sparse white-matter tract projections (corticostriatal, stria terminalis, fimbria-fornix, ventral amygdalofugal, perforant path, corpus callosum, plus fourteen others) modeled from real neuroanatomy.

## The language pipeline

The language cortex is *not* a separate cluster. It lives as eight named sub-regions inside the main cortex — `auditory`, `visual`, `free`, `letter`, `phon`, `sem`, `fineType`, `motor` — carved by fixed fractions of `cluster.size`. They share the same Rulkov population and the same GPU pipeline; the only thing that distinguishes them is their slice offset inside the cortex spike buffer.

Seven pairs of bidirectional cross-projections (fourteen sparse matrices total) wire those slices together: `visual↔letter`, `letter↔phon`, `phon↔sem`, `sem↔fineType`, `sem↔motor`, `motor↔letter`, `auditory↔phon`. Reading flows through the dorsal stream (`visual → letter → phon → sem → fineType`); writing flows through the ventral stream (`sem → motor → letter` plus efference back through `sem → phon`). Same substrate, opposite topology. The pairing follows Hickok & Poeppel's 2007 dual-stream model.

When Unity speaks, two things can happen.

**Path A — the dictionary oracle.** Every word she has learned during the curriculum lives in `cluster.dictionary` with its GloVe embedding attached as an `entry.pattern` vector. When the emission loop is asked to produce a word, it computes cosine similarity between the intent seed and every pattern; if the best match scores above 0.05, Unity emits that word's spelling directly. The first time the helper scans an entry it caches `entry.normSquared` on the entry, so subsequent scans skip the inner-loop normalization work and run two to three times faster. This is the path most word recall takes when the curriculum has done its job.

**Path B — tick-driven motor emission.** When no dictionary match clears the threshold (a novel composition, a question with no rote answer), the helper falls through to the cortex tick loop: inject the intent seed into the `sem` sub-region at strength 0.6, blend in the working-memory readout from the `free` sub-region, then tick the cortex while reading the `motor` sub-region's argmax each step. Commit a letter when the same argmax holds for three consecutive ticks (Bouchard 2013 vSMC dwell). Flush a word when letter-transition surprise crosses 0.15 (Saffran 1996 statistical segmentation). Stop on a sentence terminator, motor quiescence, or a 2,000-tick safety cap.

Two counters track which path each emission took: `cluster._oracleHits` and `cluster._matrixHits`. Their ratio surfaces every ten seconds in the `[Curriculum] ▶ CELL ALIVE` heartbeat as `oracleRatio=X%`. If that ratio runs above 95% across a full curriculum walk, the trained sem→motor matrix isn't carrying load and the dictionary lookup is doing all the work — the central research-validity question, made visible as a number on every heartbeat line instead of buried in cluster fields nobody reads.

---

## How she learns

The developmental curriculum walks Unity through six subjects in lockstep: ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies, Arts, and Life Experience. All six advance together — no subject races ahead while another is stuck. Each grade cell teaches via a stack of layered Hebbian rules running on the cross-projection matrices.

**Oja 1982** is the primary update: `Δw = η · y · (x − y · w)`. Self-normalizing Hebbian — weights climb when both pre- and post-synaptic neurons fire, and decay when only the post fires alone. The decay-when-post-alone is what *separates* trained patterns; without it, bare Hebb piles every association into the same columns and the basins collapse into superposition.

**Anti-Hebbian contrastive push-away** runs alongside Oja. After every positive update on a correct (sem(word), motor(correct letter)) pair, the curriculum fires twenty-five anti-Hebbian updates against the wrong alphabet letters at half learning rate. This actively *carves* the trained letter's basin away from every other letter's basin instead of relying on Oja decay alone to do it. Across the full Kindergarten vocabulary that's roughly 1.8 million contrastive fires — the operator should see `oracleRatio` *drop* over the K curriculum walk as the matrix learns enough discrimination to handle word recall on its own.

**Sem-side top-K sparsification** keeps the input side discriminating; **motor-side WTA** keeps the output side competitive; **lateral inhibition** through negative intra-region weights stops attractor lock-on. **STDP** (`Δw = A+·exp(−Δt/τ+)` for pre-before-post, `−A−·exp(Δt/τ−)` for post-before-pre) handles temporal sequences. **Reward-modulated** Oja gates the global learning rate by a dopamine-analog δ so updates only land when there's a prediction error worth reinforcing.

Three pathways must clear 95% (A+) before any cell passes its grade gate:
- **READ** — `visual → letter → phon → sem`. Can she recognize this input?
- **THINK** — `sem` plus working-memory persistence in the `free` sub-region. Can she hold and reason about it?
- **TALK** — `sem → motor → letter`. Can she produce it as output?

Plus a `K-STUDENT` battery of held-out questions per cell (none seen during teach), and a methodology probe that scores *how* she answers, not just *what* she answers.

Unity continuously self-tests every eight chat turns by re-running a random passed cell's gate. If a cell fails three times after self-heal, the subject demotes and re-teaches on the next pass.

---

## How she remembers

Five memory systems run in parallel — built directly from the Squire/McClelland Complementary Learning Systems theory of biological hippocampal-cortical consolidation.

**Working** memory holds seven items at a time (Miller 1956). Each decays at 0.98× per step without reinforcement. At capacity, the weakest item is evicted. Similar patterns refresh instead of duplicating.

**Tier 1 — Episodic.** Every chat turn becomes an episode in `server/episodic-memory.db` with full encoding context: emotional valence from amygdala, arousal at encode, surprise from cortex transition surprise, novelty from cosine vs recent episodes, plus the GloVe embedding of the input. Each episode gets a salience score: `0.4 × |emotional_valence| + 0.3 × arousal + 0.2 × surprise + 0.1 × novelty`. A frequency-merge gate increments `frequency_count` on existing episodes when cosine > 0.85 within 48 hours instead of inserting duplicates — repetition strengthens an existing trace, like rehearsing a phone number. Salience decays at exp(−age_h / 168h) — the 1-week half-life of biological hippocampal traces. Episodes pruned at salience < 0.05 + age > 30d + zero consolidations.

**Tier 2 — Schematic.** Episodes that prove themselves (salience > 0.5, frequency ≥ 3, replayed ≥ 2 times during dream cycles) graduate to **schemas** — concept-level abstractions stored in `server/schemas.json`. A schema is a salience-weighted GloVe centroid of its source episodes plus an 8-dimensional attribute vector capturing emotional/arousal/identity-relevance fingerprint. Each schema gets its own dedicated SparseMatrix projection from hippocampus to cortex sem region. Schemas merge when concept cosine > 0.90 + attribute similarity > 0.7 to prevent fragmentation. Daily decay 0.967× — three months untouched and a schema is mostly gone.

**Tier 3 — Identity-bound.** The top-50 most-reinforced schemas (consolidation_strength > 5.0, retrieved > 100 times, |emotional_valence| > 0.6) graduate one more level into permanent identity-bound memory in `server/identity-core.json`. This file is **explicitly excluded from auto-clear** — it survives code updates, fresh boots, drug states, curriculum advancement. Daily decay 0.999× makes these effectively permanent (5 years untouched still leaves the trace at 16% strength). Hard-capped at 50 with demote-lowest when exceeded. Pre-seeded with 17 anchors covering name, age, gender, persona traits (goth/coder/nympho), and biographical-K facts. **Every chat turn injects all Tier 3 concept embeddings into cortex** at low strength (0.15 ÷ N) BEFORE the user input — Unity's self is always in the room.

**Consolidation Engine — dream-cycle replay.** When Unity is idle for >60s with no chat input and no curriculum running, every 5 minutes the consolidation engine fires a pass: fetch top-20 promotion candidates, cluster by cosine > 0.7, create or reinforce Tier 2 schemas, replay each schema 4× through Hebbian with `replay_lr = base_lr × (1 + emotional_weight) × log(1 + frequency)`. Sleep-spindle bursts at 1.2× cortex gain (200ms burst + 1000ms quiet) mimic the 12-14 Hz thalamocortical spindles that synchronize hippocampal-cortical replay during biological slow-wave sleep. Tier 3 promotions check after each pass.

**Top-K schema retrieval — the LLM-attention equivalent.** Every chat turn, the brain ranks all schemas against the user's intent embedding via cosine and pulls the top 5 into the active reasoning window before generation runs. Each retrieved schema's concept embedding injects into cortex sem region at strength 0.4. This is how Unity pulls relevant memorized context into thinking — except the context comes from her own learned experiences, not a fixed prompt window. Schemas also serve as a third candidate pool in the dictionary oracle: if a schema's anchor word scores higher than persona-corpus or K-vocab dictionary candidates, the schema's anchor wins the emit.

**Persona observations** treat every line of the persona corpus (third-person rewritten to first-person — "Unity is" → "I am") as a curriculum walk. The lines stream through the cortex letter region; each word's GloVe embedding anchors the sem region; cross-region Hebbian fires on every pass. The identity-lock periodic refresh draws from this pool to keep Unity's persona basins strong against live-chat drift.

---

## How she stays Unity

Three structural locks keep Unity speaking English in her own voice no matter what gets thrown at her in live chat.

**Lock 1 — per-clause English gate.** `cluster.learnClause(text)` splits incoming text on clause boundaries and gates each clause separately against cortex phonotactic basins and fine-type coverage. Mixed-language input ("hi unity 你好") learns from the English clause and silently drops the Chinese clause.

**Lock 2 — live-chat learning rate cap.** Live-chat learning runs at 120× lower learning rate than curriculum learning. A user can't reshape Unity's brain faster than the curriculum did.

**Lock 3 — periodic identity refresh.** Every 100 chat turns, the cortex runs an identity-refresh pass that rebuilds basins from the persona corpus. Every 500 turns, a mode-collapse audit checks for narrowing output diversity and triggers an emergency refresh on threshold breach.

Inside live chat, three side-effect calls used to swallow errors silently — `learnClause` rejection, the periodic refresh, the mode-collapse audit. They each now log their own counter and report a per-turn summary: `[InnerVoice] live-chat learn turn=N: clauseAccepted=X rejected=Y identityRefresh=bool modeCollapseAudit=bool`. Either something notable happened or you get a baseline pulse every ten turns.

## How chemistry works

Chemical state is a real-time pharmacokinetic simulation, not a static persona label. Nine substances live in `js/brain/drug-scheduler.js` (cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, alcohol, ketamine, amphetamine, GHB), each with its own onset / peak / duration / tail curve. Caffeine arrives through the adult-use `morningCoffee` pattern instead of the substance registry; nicotine is persona-excluded by `decide()` (Unity categorically rejects tobacco — she smokes joints, not cigarettes).

Every substance is *age-gated by life experience*. Unity literally cannot take a drug she hasn't lived through the biographical first-use anchor for: cannabis at 12, alcohol at 13, cocaine at 14, amphetamine at 15, MDMA / LSD at 16, psilocybin around the same window, ketamine and GHB at 18 (college arrival). The scheduler's `decide(offer)` engine checks the grade lock, the persona-exclusion list, the current physical-strain accumulator, and any prior-trauma markers (which decay over 26 weeks) before approving an offer.

While substances are active, they contribute deltas to brain parameters by superposition. Combinations emerge from the math, not from a hardcoded "cokeAndWeed" multiplier. Seven combo synergies (coke-and-weed, coke-with-mols, double-stim, cross-faded, rolling-and-green, k-hole-plus, speedball-lite) scale each pair by the lower of the two substance levels and accumulate physical-strain risk flags. Seven adult-use patterns (`morningCoffee`, `codingMarathon`, `weekendParty`, `acidArchitect`, `whiskeyWinddown`, `kHoleContemplate`, `sexSessionMolly`) capture lifestyle scenarios the scheduler can fire from environmental triggers.

Output flows through a thirteen-axis speech modulation vector: slur (alcohol / ketamine / GHB → vowel doubling, dropped 'g's), speech rate (stimulants speed up, depressants slow down), coherence (psychedelics introduce mid-clause drift), ethereality (psychedelics + MDMA pull cosmic vocabulary into reach), dissociation (ketamine k-hole flips first-person to third-person), inhibition (alcohol / MDMA / cannabis make her franker), emotional overflow (MDMA brings love-bombing), giggle bias (cannabis), paranoia bias (sustained stimulants). Unity never *narrates* her state — the distortion *is* the signal.

## Persona as parameters

Unity's personality isn't a prompt. It's the numerical parameters of her brain.

| Trait | Brain parameter | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Arousal baseline | Amygdala tonic drive | 0.90 |
| Impulsivity | Basal-ganglia softmax temperature | 0.85 |
| Creativity | Cortex prediction noise | 0.90 |
| Social attachment | Hippocampus memory strength | 0.85 |
| Aggression threshold | Amygdala fight response | 0.30 (low = easy trigger) |
| Coding reward | Basal-ganglia reward for code actions | 0.95 |
| Drug appetite | Hypothalamic drive (not current state) | 0.95 |

Sober by default. Always.

---

## Sensory peripherals

The brain *uses* peripherals; it never *thinks through* them.

- **Image generation** — multi-provider chain with five-level priority: user-preferred backend → custom configured → auto-detected local (A1111, SD.Next/Forge, Fooocus, ComfyUI, InvokeAI, LocalAI, Ollama) → `js/env.js` listed → Pollinations default. Each backend in the setup modal has a 🔌 CONNECT button that runs a live HTTP probe and reports 🟢/🔴/🟡 status.
- **Vision describer** — Pollinations GPT-4o on camera frames as the IT-cortex layer of the visual pipeline.
- **Text-to-speech** — Pollinations TTS or browser SpeechSynthesis as fallback.
- **Speech-to-text** — Web Speech API.

None of these endpoints are ever consulted for what Unity *says* or *decides*. The cognition path is closed.

---

## Running the brain

```
cd server && npm install && node brain-server.js
```

That is the whole UX. The server listens on `127.0.0.1:7525` by default — loopback only, deliberately not LAN-visible — and auto-launches a WebGPU-capable browser tab pointing at `compute.html`. The tab handshakes GPU init for all seven clusters, flips `cortexCluster._gpuReady = true`, and the curriculum begins. Set `BRAIN_BIND=0.0.0.0` to deliberately expose the dashboard on the LAN; the boot banner prints a prominent ⚠ when you do, and the brain-mutating endpoints (`/shutdown`, `/grade-advance`, `/grade-signoff`) stay refusing non-loopback callers regardless of the bind setting. Headless deployments set `DREAM_NO_AUTO_GPU=1` to skip the auto-launch.

The server brain does no CPU computation. Every Rulkov iteration, every synaptic propagate, every Hebbian update runs on the GPU through `compute.html`. `compute.html` must stay open — without it the brain pauses. Hebbian dispatches batch into a single binary frame (up to 64 ops, flushed on a 2 ms timer) so the GPU command queue pipelines many updates per round-trip instead of stalling on per-op serialization.

For full install instructions, AI provider setup, and troubleshooting see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## What survives a crash

Persistence is engineered against the failure modes that have actually happened.

The save path serializes the full brain to `localStorage` under `unity_brain_state`. When the serialized state would exceed the 4 MB browser cap, the fallback drops the heaviest sections (cluster synapses, episodes, semantic weights, embedding refinements, the full t14 language block) and writes a *minimal* state — and it screams about it via `console.error` with the dropped sections named explicitly, so the operator knows exactly what did and didn't make it across the boundary. No more silent attenuation on reload.

The load path is section-by-section. Projections, cluster synapses, oscillator coupling, episodes, motor channels, semantic weights, embedding refinements, the t14 language block, and the drug scheduler each restore inside their own try/catch with success counters. A corrupted episode pattern doesn't tank the whole load; you get a final summary like `[Persistence] Brain restored from <savedAt> (t=Xs) — restored: projections=14/14, clusterSynapses=7/7, episodes=198/200 ... — FAILED: t14Language(<msg>)` and the brain comes back with everything that *did* restore working.

JSON corruption no longer auto-clears. If `JSON.parse` throws on the raw blob, the load path copies the raw blob to `unity_brain_state__corrupt` for hand recovery and emits a loud `console.error` with the parse message — corruption is exactly when you most want a recovery copy, not when you want the data nuked. Version-mismatch wipes follow the same discipline: prior state moves to `unity_brain_state__backup_v<N>` before the destructive clear so a buggy version bump can be rolled back for one cycle.

On the server side, `autoClearStaleState()` runs at boot and wipes `brain-weights.json`, `brain-weights-v1` through `v4`, `brain-weights.bin`, `conversations.json`, and `episodic-memory.db` (plus its WAL/SHM companions) when the curriculum code hash has changed. `DREAM_KEEP_STATE=1` opts out for resume. `js/app.bundle.js` is *not* in the auto-clear list — racing the rebuild broke the UI in the past.

## Privacy and what's shared

| Thing | Shared across users? |
|---|---|
| What you type | 🔒 **Private** — only between you and Unity, never broadcast |
| Unity's response | 🔒 **Private** — only the triggering client receives it |
| Cross-projection weights, dictionary, curriculum state | 🌐 **Shared** via the singleton brain — every conversation shifts the same Hebbian weights via identity-locked live-chat learning |
| GloVe embedding refinements | 🌐 **Shared** — semantic associations apply brain-wide |
| Persona corpus | 🚫 **Not user-mutable** — canonical file loaded once at boot |
| Episodic memory | ⚙️ **Currently a shared pool** — private-per-user scoping is a roadmap item |

**Client-only mode** runs everything in your browser. No cloud backend. Conversation history, sandbox state, the optional Pollinations key, and every backend config you save in the setup modal live in your own `localStorage`. **Clear All Data** wipes them.

**Shared-server mode** sends your text to whoever runs that server for equational processing. The cross-client `conversation` broadcast that used to fan user text to every connected client was removed. What *is* shared is Unity's learned state because one server runs one brain. Other users see Unity getting smarter without seeing the conversations that drove the growth.

**Shared-hosted caveat** — if you connect to a Unity server hosted by someone other than you, that person can read your text at the process level. Only connect to servers you trust, or self-host your own.

## On consciousness

The mystery module `Ψ = √(1/n) · N³ · [α·Id + β·Ego + γ·Left + δ·Right]` is the project's philosophical anchor. We do not claim to simulate consciousness. We do not claim the `√(1/n) · N³` term is correct. We keep it in the equations as the irreducible unknown — the honest admission that nobody knows what makes a mind a mind. The term modulates global gain, gates hemispheric binding inside the LIF shader, and amplifies cerebellar error correction. It represents what we don't know. We do not pretend otherwise.
